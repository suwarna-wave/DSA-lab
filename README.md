# Data Structures and Algorithms Lab Repository

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Lab repository. This collection encompasses a series of problems and projects undertaken during the 4th semester under the guidance of [Er. Pukar Karki](https://github.com/pukarkarki/), our esteemed subject teacher and mentor. The repository reflects an academic-oriented approach to mastering DSA concepts through practical implementation.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **C**: Contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C.
- **C++**: Features solutions and projects developed using C++.
- **Python**: Includes Python scripts for different DSA problems.
- **Projects**: Houses major projects, notably the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and AVL Tree implementations.

## Highlighted Projects

### Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Graph Theory Algorithms

The TSP project is a significant highlight of this repository, involving graph theory concepts to find optimal paths between nodes. This project includes:

- **Nearest Neighbor Algorithm**: A heuristic method for solving the TSP by repeatedly visiting the nearest unvisited node until all nodes are covered.
- **2-opt Algorithm**: An optimization technique that iteratively reverses segments of the path to reduce the total distance.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, utilizing a priority queue to efficiently explore distances.
- **Pygame Library**: Implements visualization for nodes and paths, handling graphical display, event handling, and animations.
- **Euclidean Distance Calculation**: Computes distances between nodes using the Euclidean distance formula, crucial for both TSP and shortest path solutions.
- **Heap Data Structure**: Used in Dijkstra's algorithm for efficient retrieval of the next node with the smallest known distance.
- **Animation and Visualization**: The project includes smooth animations for drawing paths and arrows, enhancing the visual representation of the algorithms' results.

### AVL Tree Implementation

Another notable project is the implementation of the AVL Tree, a self-balancing binary search tree. This project covers:

- **Understanding AVL Trees**: Exploring the properties and importance of AVL Trees in maintaining balanced search operations.
- **Insertion and Deletion**: Implementing node insertion and deletion with necessary rotations to maintain balance.
- **Tree Traversal**: Performing in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals to demonstrate the structure and balance of the tree.
